.
Given an interval [a..b] and a set of digits {x,y,z ....} (each digit is of course between 0 and 9) how do we count th occurences of these digits inside the given interval ? in a time efficient way. 
the used logic is explained here: https://selladev.wordpress.com/2017/10/04/finding-the-number-of-occurrences-of-a-specific-digits-between-two-given-numbers/
